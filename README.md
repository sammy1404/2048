# 2048 Game in Python

This is a simple command-line version of the popular **2048** puzzle game implemented in Python. The goal is to slide numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid and combine them to create a tile with the number 2048.

## How to Play

- Use `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` to move the tiles:
  - `W` - Move up
  - `A` - Move left
  - `S` - Move down
  - `D` - Move right
- After each move, a new tile (either 2 or 4) will randomly appear in an empty spot on the grid.
- Combine two tiles of the same number to merge them into one tile of their sum.
- The game ends when there are no empty spaces left on the grid and no more valid moves.
- To exit the game, press `Q`.

- Python 3.x
